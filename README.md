## Description

The task of this project is to build the back end for an e-commerce website and configure a working Express.js API to Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.  This application would use MYSQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect Express API to a MySQL Database and a dotenv package to use environment variables to store sensitive data.

This application would show the creation of database using MySQL with models and associations and also the API routes to perform RESTful CRUD Operations.  This would be demonstrated in the Walkthrough Video.
